About
=====

The idevicerestore tool allows to restore firmware files to iOS devices.

It is a full reimplementation of all granular steps which are performed during
restore of a firmware to a device.

In general, upgrades and downgrades are possible, however subject to
availability of SHSH blobs from Apple for signing the firmare files.

To restore a device to some firmware, simply run the following:
$ sudo idevicerestore -l

This will download and restore a device to the latest firmware available.
